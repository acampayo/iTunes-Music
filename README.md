# iTunes-Music

For the implementation of the app I have choosen a MVVM architechture trying to follow clean architechture. On the other hand, I have used the following third party libraries:

- RxJava: For composing asynchronous tasks using observable sequences
- Retrofit 2: For Networking
- Dagger 2: To manage the dependency injection of the app
- Glide: To load and caching images
